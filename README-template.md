## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I'm still learning how to work with Figma, the design properties still confuse me because they change a lot from Mobile to Desktop. I also started working with calc() and with clamp(), they made my life easier on the responsive design but took a couple of tries to understand them (I actually don't think that I fully do).
The curves at the end of the divs where also something that I really struggle with, I ended up using the ellipse property but making sure that it stayed where I wanted it when changing the vw was so hard, I hope that eventually I found out a better way to do it. 
The other thing that I struggled a lot with was the phone image and getting it on the center horinzontally but staying at the end of the div, everytime I change de vw it went wherever it wanted, that was so fustrating and I honestly don't think that I got it right. 

But I'm really happy to say that a understand grid and flexbox really good, that was something that when I started was so hard to wrap my head around.


### Continued development

Using responsive properties and calc() and clamp(), learning about clip-path. 
Using position:absolute to play with the img positioning and making it responsive.
